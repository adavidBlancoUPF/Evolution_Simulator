# Evolution_Simulator
I code in Matlab that simulates the evolutionary processes that could occur in a population of butterflies. Due to the pressure to camouflage from different predators such as owls, lizards and birds, we will witness how the color of their wings will tend to change from white to black in case the black color allows them to go more unnoticed in the eyes of predators (or vice versa).
